Beam Search Pseudocode

Function BS (graph,start,end,beam_width)
  
  current = start
  create a beam list
  create a visited list
  
  append current to the visited list
  
  while current != end:
    for all neighbours in current node:
      if neighbour not in visited:
        add neighbour to the beam list
        
    Sort the beam list based on the cost of reaching each node 
    Keep only the top beam width number of nodes in the beam list
    
    set current = beam.pop(0)
    
    append current to the visited list
    
    if not beam:
      return "No Solution Found"
      
    
  return visited
