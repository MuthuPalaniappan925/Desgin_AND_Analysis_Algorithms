Breadth First Search Pseudocode

Function BFS (graph,start_vertex)
  
  create a empty queue and enqueue the start_vertex
  create a set of visted vertex and add the start_vertex
  
  while queue is not empty:
    
    dequeue a vertex from the queue and asign as current_vertex
    for each neighbours in current_vertex:
      if the neighbours not in the visited vertex:
        add the neighbour to the visited vertex
        enqueue the neighbour to the queue
        
   return the set of visited vertex
