Depth-First-Search Pseudocode

Function DFS (Graph,Vertex)
  
  create a stack S
  mark Vertex as visited
  push Vertex to S
  
  While S is not empty:
    t = pop from S
    for all edges e in G incident on t:
      if all other endpoint of e is not visited:
        mark the other endpoint of e is visited
        push the other endpoint of e to S
        
  display stack S
